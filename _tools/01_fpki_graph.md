The [FPKI Graph](https://fpki-graph.fpki-lab.gov/){:target="_blank"} helps you see the relationships between the CAs and Bridges in the FPKI ecosystem and the cross-certified CAs. It also shows you how each CA certificate validates to the Federal Common Policy Root, also known as COMMON. You will see COMMON at the center of the FPKI Graph with the subordinate certificates in the outer links from COMMON.

Click on any dot in the FPKI Graph to see that CA's inbound and outbound relationships.

The FPKI Graph uses Authority Information Access (AIA) and Subject Information Access (SIA) extensions to link the CA certificates with each other. Each CA that validates to COMMON should have an AIA extension in its public certificate that gives a URL where you can see the certificates issued to the signing CA. If you follow each CA certificateâ€™s AIA chain, it will lead you to the COMMON certificate. 

For the outbound relationships, each certificate should also have a SIA extension that provides a link to view the subordinate CA certificates that have been issued. As an example, the SIA for COMMON is http://http.fpki.gov/fcpca/caCertsIssuedByfcpca.p7c. If you follow this link, you will find 12 certificates that are issued by COMMON as subordinate certificates. The SIA links from each of these 12 certificates will in turn display in the next level in the FPKI graph.
