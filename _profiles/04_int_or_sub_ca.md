## Worksheet 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermediate or Subordinate CA Certificate Profile

| **Field** |       |       | **Value**                             |
| :-------- | :---: | :---: | :-------------------------------     |
| Version   |       |       | V3 (2)                                 |
| Serial Number   |       |       | Must be a unique, positive number. |
| Issuer Signature Algorithm   |       |       |  One of the following: <br>sha256WithRSAEncryption {1.2.840.113549.1.1.11} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA256 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.2} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA384 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.3} <br>ecdsa-with-SHA512 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.4} | 
| Issuer   |       |       |  Unique X.500 Issuing CA Distinguished Name (DN). <br>CAs operating under the _X.509 Certificate Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework_ (aka, Common Policy CP) must use one of the name forms specified in Section 3.1.1.<br>PrintableString encoding should be used whenever possible for Issuer and Subject DNs. |
| Validity Period   |       |       |  No longer than 10 years from date of issue.<br>Expressed in UTCTime for dates until end of 2049 and GeneralizedTime for dates thereafter.  | 
| Subject   |       |       |   Unique X.500 Issuing CA DN.<br>CAs operating under the Common Policy CP must use one of the name forms specified in Section 3.1.1.<br>Subject DN should be encoded exactly as encoded in the Issuer field of certificates issued by the subject.<br>PrintableString encoding should be used whenever possible for Issuer and Subject DNs.   |
| Subject Public Key Information   |       |       |   For RSA, must be at least 2048 bit modulus, rsaEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 1}.<BR>For ECC, implicitly specify parameters through an OID associated with a NIST-approved curve referenced in NIST SP 800-78-4.<sup>[1](#1)</sup>   |
| Signature   |       |       |   sha256WithRSAEncryption {1.2.840.113549.1.1.11}<br>or ECDSA with appropriate Hash.   |
|               |                 |              |                                       |
| **Extension** |  **Required**   | **Critical** | **Value**                             |
| Authority Key Identifier  | Mandatory |  |  Octet string (typically derived using the SHA-1 hash of the signerâ€™s public key). |
| Subject Key Identifier  | Mandatory |  |  Octet string (typically derived using the SHA-1 hash of the subject public key).<br>This extension is required to assist in path development.<br>The value in this field must be the same value that the subject CA uses in the Authority Key Identifier extension of the certificates and CRLs that it signs with the private key that corresponds to the subject public key included in this certificate. |
| Key Usage  | Mandatory | True |  keyCertSign<br>cRLSign<br>digitalSignature (optional)<br>nonRepudiation (optional)<br>DigitalSignature and nonRepudiation are allowed only when the CA also signs OCSP responses. |
| Basic Constraints   | Mandatory | True |  cA=True; path length constraint is optional. |
| Subject Information Access   | Mandatory |  |  id-ad-caRepository (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.5) access method entry that contains at least one HTTP URL for .p7c file containing certificates issued by this CA.<br>Certificates may also include a URI name form to specify an LDAP-accessible directory server.<br>Each URI must point to a location where CA certificates issued by the subject of this certificate may be found. <br>SubjectInfoAccess may be omitted if the subject CA does not issue any CA certificates. |
| Certificate Policies   | Mandatory  |  | Applicable certificate policy identifiers. |
| CRL Distribution Points   | Mandatory  |  | This extension must appear in all certificates and include at least one HTTP URI to a file containing a DER-encoded CRL with a file type of _application/pkix-crl_.<br>This profile prohibits CRLs segmented by reason code; therefore, the reasons and cRLIssuer fields must be omitted. |
| Authority Information Access   | Mandatory  |  | authorityInfoAccess consists of a sequence of accessMethod and accessLocation pairs.<BR>id-ad-caIssuers {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2} access method entry that contains HTTP URL for .p7c file containing certificates issued to this CA.<br>LDAP URI may optionally be included.<br>id-ad-ocsp {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1} access method entry that contains HTTP URL for the Issuing CA OCSP Responder, if available.<br>OCSP is mandatory for CAs issuing PIV, PIV-I, or TLS subscriber certificates. |
| Policy Constraints   | Optional  |  | Either requireExplicitPolicy or inhibitPolicyMapping may be present.<br>If present, this extension should be marked as noncritical, to support legacy applications that cannot process policyConstraints.<br>InhibitPolicyMapping SkipCerts = 0 for a CA certificate issued under the same CP as issuing CA, to not allow transitive trust. |
| Inhibit Any Policy   | Optional  |  | SkipCerts=0. |
| Name Constraints   | Optional  | True | If present, any combination of permitted and excluded subtrees may appear.<br>If permitted and excluded subtrees overlap, the excluded subtree takes precedence. |
| Issuer Alternative Name   | Optional  |  | Any name types may be present; most common is rfc822Name for email of PKI administrator. |
| Subject Alternative Name   | Optional  |  | Any name types may be present; most common is rfc822Name for email of subject PKI administrator. |
