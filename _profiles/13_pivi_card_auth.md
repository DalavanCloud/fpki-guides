## Worksheet 13:&nbsp;&nbsp;PIV-I Card Authentication Certificate Profile

| **Field** |       |       | **Value**                             |
| :-------- | :---: | :---: | :-------------------------------     |
| Version   |       |       | V3 (2)                                 |
| Serial Number   |       |       | Must be a unique, positive number. |
| Issuer Signature Algorithm   |       |       |  One of the following: <br>sha256WithRSAEncryption {1.2.840.113549.1.1.11}<br>ecdsa-with-SHA256 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.2}<br>ecdsa-with-SHA384 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.3}<br>ecdsa-with-SHA512 {1.2.840.10045.4.3.4} | 
| Issuer   |       |       |  Unique X.500 Issuing CA Distinguished Name (DN).<br>PrintableString encoding should be used whenever possible for Issuer and Subject DNs.  |
| Validity Period   |       |       |  No longer than 3 years from date of issue.<br>Expressed in UTCTime for dates until end of 2049 and GeneralizedTime for dates thereafter.  | 
| Subject   |       |       |   MUST include a Non-NULL Subject DN. See naming requirements in the _X.509 Certificate Policy For The Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)_.<sup>[1](#1)</sup><br>PrintableString encoding should be used whenever possible for Issuer and Subject DNs.  |
| Subject Public Key Information   |       |       |   For RSA, must be at least 2048 bit modulus, rsaEncryption {1.2.840.113549.1.1.1}.<br>For ECC, implicitly specify parameters through an OID associated with a NIST-approved curve referenced in NIST SP 800-78-4.<sup>[2](#2)</sup>   |
| Signature   |       |       |   sha256WithRSAEncryption 1.2.840.113549.1.1.11}<br>or ECDSA with appropriate Hash.   |
|               |                 |              |                                       |
| **Extension** |  **Required**   | **Critical** | **Value**                             |
| Key Usage  | Mandatory | True |  digitalSignature  |
| Authority Information Access   | Mandatory  |  | id-ad-caIssuers {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2} access method entry that contains HTTP URL for .p7c file containing certificates issued to Issuing CA.<br>id-ad-ocsp {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1} access method entry that contains HTTP URL for the Issuing CA OCSP Responder.<br>OCSP is required for PIV-I CardAuth.  | 
| Subject Key Identifier   | Mandatory |  | Octet string  |
| CRL Distribution Points   | Mandatory |   |  This extension must appear in all certificates and include at least one HTTP URI to a file containing a DER-encoded CRL with a file type of _application/pkix-crl_.<br>This profile prohibits CRLs segmented by reason code; therefore, the reasons and cRLIssuer fields must be omitted. | 
| Certificate Policies   | Mandatory  |  | Applicable certificate policy.<BR>Must have a policy mapping to PIV-I cardAuth.<BR>Other policies may be asserted as well. |
| Authority Key Identifier   | Mandatory  |  | Octet string (same as subject key identifier in Issuing CA certificate). |
| Extended Key Usage   | Mandatory | True |  This extension shall assert only:<br>id-PIV-cardAuth keyPurposeID {2.16.840.1.101.3.6.8}<br>The id-PIV-cardAuth keyPurposeID specifies that the public key is used to authenticate the PIV-I card rather than the PIV-I cardholder.  |
| Subject Alternative Name   | Mandatory  | False | Must include a UUID. No other name forms may be included.<br>This field contains the UUID from the CHUID of the PIV-I card encoded as a URI, as specified in RFC 4122, Section 3.<sup>[3](#3)</sup>  |
| Subject Directory Attributes   | Optional  |  | This extension may be included to indicate the cardholder's country or countries of citizenship, as specified in RFC 5280.<sup>[4](#4)</sup><br>countryOfCitizenship {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.4}<br>ISO 3166<sup>[5](#5)</sup> specifies country codes. | 
| Issuer Alternative Name   | Optional  |  |   |
