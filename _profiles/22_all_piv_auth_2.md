permalink: profiles/allpivauth2/
---

This profile specifies the unique settings required for X.509 PIV Authentication and Derived PIV Authentication certificates issued under the _Common Policy CP_,<sup>[1](#1)</sup> as well as PIV-I Authentication certificates issued under the _FBCA CP_.<sup>[2](#2)</sup> (For standard, detailed certificate information, see the _ITU-T X.509 Recommendation_<sup>[3](#3)</sup> and RFC 5280<sup>[4](#4)</sup>.)

## Superseded Versions

This profile supersedes three previously published profile worksheets:

## Updated Profile Extension Details
<!--Have these extensions indeed been updated since the prevous 3 (superseded) worksheets? Unclear why this information should be upfront unless there is something new for the user (i.e., "What's New for This Version" or "What Has Changed"). Reason for the limited subset of extension details here should be explained/understood.-->

## Mandatory Extensions

These are **Mandatory** extensions for all PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication certificates.

>**Notes:**
* Critical extensions that are NOT listed in the profile MUST NOT be included in certificates or CRLs issued under the _Common Policy CP_. Issuers may include information in non-critical extensions for local use, but other Federal PKI organizations are not required to process it. 
* The OSCP server must respond on Port 80.<!--Can this statement go into the profile somewhere?-->

| :-------- | :-----: | :----- | 
| Key Usage  | True |  digitalSignature  | 
| Subject Key Identifier   |  | Octet string  | 
| CRL Distribution Points   | |  This extension must appear in all certificates and include at least one HTTP URI to a file containing a DER-encoded CRL with a file type of _application/pkix-crl_.<br>This profile prohibits CRLs segmented by reason code; therefore, omit the reasons and cRLIssuer fields. | 
| Authority Key Identifier   |  | Octet string (same as subject key identifier in Issuing CA certificate). | Octet string (same as subject key identifier in Issuing CA certificate). | Octet string (same as subject key identifier in Issuing CA certificate). |
