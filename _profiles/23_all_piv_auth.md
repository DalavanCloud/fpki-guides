title: PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication Certificate Profile Worksheet
permalink: profiles/allpivauth3/
---
This worksheet specifies the unique settings required for:

* X.509 **PIV Authentication** certificates issued under the _X.509 Certificate Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework_ (aka, _Common Policy CP_)<sup>[1](#1)</sup>
* X.509 **Derived PIV Authentication** certificates issued under the _Common Policy CP_
* X.509 **PIV-I Authentication** certificates issued under the  _X.509 Certificate Policy for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority_ (aka, _FBCA CP_)<sup>[2](#2)</sup>

For standard certificate information, see the _ITU-T X.509 Recommendation_<sup>[3](#3)</sup> and RFC 5280.<sup>[4](#4)</sup>

## Traceability

This worksheet supersedes three previously published worksheets:

| **Subject**   |   For PIV and Derived PIV certificates, must use a name form specified in the _Common Policy CP_, Section 3.1. For PIV-I, must use a name form specified in the _FBCA CP_, Section 7.1.4. PrintableString encoding should be used whenever possible for Issuer and Subject DNs.   |
| **Subject Public Key Information**  |   For RSA, must be at least 2048 bit modulus, rsaEncryption {1.2.840.113549.1.1.1}. For ECC, implicitly specify parameters through an OID associated with an approved curve from NIST SP 800-78-4.<sup>[7](#7)</sup>   |

## Mandatory Extensions Common to PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication

_These **Mandatory** extensions apply to **all** PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication certificates._

| **Mandatory<br>Extension** |  **Critical** | **Value** | 
| :-------- | :-----: | :----- | 
| **Key Usage**  | True |  digitalSignature. nonRepudiation is NOT allowed.  | 
| **Authority Information Access**  |  | id-ad-caIssuers {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2} access method entry that contains an HTTP URI for a .p7c file containing certificates issued to Issuing CA.<br>id-ad-ocsp {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1} access method entry that contains an HTTP URI for the OCSP server that provides status information about the certificate. |
| **Subject Key Identifier**   |  | Octet string  | 
| **CRL Distribution Points**   | |  Must appear in all certificates and include at least one HTTP URI to a file containing a DER-encoded CRL with an _application/pkix-crl_ file type. Omit the reasons and cRLIssuer fields. | 
| **Authority Key Identifier**   |  | Octet string (same as Subject Key Identifier in Issuing CA certificate). |  

## Mandatory Extensions Unique to PIV, Derived PIV, or PIV-I Authentication

_These **Mandatory** extensions are **unique** to either PIV, Derived PIV, or PIV-I Authentication certificates._

| **Mandatory<br>Extension**  | **Critical** | **PIV** | **Derived PIV**  |  **PIV-I** |
| :-------- | :------ | :----- | :-----  | :-----     |
| **Certificate Policies**   |  | id-fpki-common-<br>authentication {2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.13}  |  id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth {2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.40}<br>_**OR**_ id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth-hardware {2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.41}  | A policy OID that maps to id-fpki-certpcy-pivi-hardware {2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.18}.   |
| **Subject Alternative Name**   |  | Must include FASC-N name form. After October 15, 2015, must also include a UUID encoded as a URI, as specified in RFC 4122,<sup>[8](#8)</sup> Section 3. Additional name forms may be present to support local applications.  | Must include a UUID encoded as a URI, as specified in RFC 4122, Section 3. Additional name forms may be present to support local applications.  | Same value as for Derived PIV.  | 
| **PIV Interim**   |  | piv-interim indicator {2.16.840.1.101.3.6.9.1}, defined in FIPS 201-2 as _PIV NACI indicator_. FALSE, if NACI successfully adjudicated at issuance. TRUE, if FBI NCHC successful, but adjudication not finalized. Also TRUE if NACI initiated but not completed at issuance.  | Same value as for PIV.  |   | 

## Optional Extensions Common to PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication

_These **Optional** extensions apply to **all** PIV, Derived PIV, and PIV-I Authentication certificates._

| **Optional<br>Extension**  | **Critical** | **Value** |
| :-------- | :------ | :----- |
| **Extended Key Usage**   | True | If included, EKU should be non-critical and include:<br>Microsoft Smart Card Logon {1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2}, only if the private key is on a<br>smart card.<br>TLS Client Authentication {3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2}<br>pkinit-KPClientAuth {3.6.1.5.2.3.4}<br>Additional key purposes may be specified (e.g., id-kp-secureShellClient {3.6.1.5.5.7.3.21}). | 
| **Subject Directory Attributes** |    | May be included to identify the cardholder's country/countries of citizenship, as specified in RFC 5280. countryOfCitizenship {1.3.6.1.5.5.7.9.4}. ISO 3166<sup>[9](#9)</sup> specifies country codes. |
